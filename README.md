orksheet 1 - welcome to R

Welcome to the second part of the Bioinformatics class! 

As you know, the first part of the class focused on Perl, the command line and emacs. This second part of the class will focus on R. It is taught by me, Daniel Fulop. We'll do R for 5 weeks and after that, you have another 3.5 weeks to work on your projects. 

In this class, you will be mostly working by yourself or with a partner. You get worksheets and work at your own pace. Worksheets are due 1 week after they’re assigned in class. If you turn them in late, you will be deducted 10% for each day late. I am working on a means of digital submission of worksheets, probably through iLearn.

Task 1 - Be a class ambassador and visit my office hours. 

Goal: Each day of the course (except day 1), I would like to know how you are doing. I also would like to get to know everyone. Each of you should therefore sign up to come to my office hours once during the coming 5 weeks. My office hours are Tuesday and Thursday 1:30-2:30. Use this sign up spreadsheet: https://goo.gl/4rw9i6


When you come to my office hours (probably with a colleague), be prepared to tell me at least one thing you found interesting in the last class and one thing you found confusing, hard or boring. Office hours will be held in this computer lab.

Did you sign up for an office hour meeting?

Yes / No

Worksheet 2 - R inspiration

R is a software environment and programming language for statistics that is used by many people, among them many biologists. The goal of this worksheet is for you to find inspiration to learn R by reading about how other people use R and how these people got started with R. 

Task 1 - read four stories from https://whyiuser.wordpress.com/
Go to the website, pick a story that looks like it could be interesting and answer the following questions. Repeat four times.

Story #1:
1. What is the R user's name?  James Curley 

2. What topic do they work on? Neurobiology and Social Behavior 

3. Which answer did you find most surprising / what did you learn from reading their story?
Hes been using R for 5 years 



Story #2:
1. What is the R user's name? Cormac Nolan 

2. What topic do they work on? Data analyst

3. Which answer did you find most surprising / what did you learn from reading their story?  
That he works in business, not academia




 
Story #3:
1. What is the R user's name? Abby Heithoff 	

2. What topic do they work on? Neurobiology of HIV and AIDS

3. Which answer did you find most surprising / what did you learn from reading their story?  
She learned mostly how to use R online 



Story #4:
1. What is the R user's name? Rob Rudis 

2. What topic do they work on? 
 Cyber security 
3. Which answer did you find most surprising / what did you learn from reading their story?  
He uses R for breach impact analysis 




Task 2 - summarize

After reading several stories about people who use R, is there anything problem that you think R can help you to solve? Is there anything particular that caught your interest?

I believe that when I hopefully start doing research I can maybe utilize a program like R instead of MatLab because I’m not too great at creating my own codes

Is there anything that didn’t make sense to you or was unexpected? 

I didnt realize how far R can be taken, especially outside the science world. 


Task 3 - share with your neighbor
Compare notes with at least one neighbor. Why did you neighbor choose the stories he or she read? Did you pick up something different? Did the stories change your ideas about R?

I wasn’t present in class for this day, I was home sick.

Worksheet 3 - Do chapter 1 of online R tutorial https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r

You need to create a login for Codeschool, then you get started with the R class. 
For this worksheet, you'll do chapter 1. 

1. Do you see any differences with Perl? Write down at least 3 differences

I see many differences for one not having to put “perl –e” in front of the command line
Not having to enclose everything 
The commands are much easier and less confusing than in R 

2. How would you ask R to multiply 7 and 8? Or to divide 7 by 8? 

7 * 8    7/8

3. Which of the following expressions would return a logical (or boolean) value? 

A. 3 < 4 
B. 3 == 4
C. x <- 4
D. 4 -> x

A would return a Boolean value 

4. Can you assign a logical value to a variable called "y"? How would you assign FALSE to a variable called "y"? 

Yes,   y <- FALSE 

5. Name three functions you learned in the tutorial. What do they do? 

I learned the sum function, it adds up numbers 
I learned the rep  function, which repeats a value as many times as you assign to it 
I learned the sqrt function, which take the square root of an integer 

6. What is the function you use to list all the files in your current directory? 
List.files

7. What is the function you use to run all the code in a file called "file.R"? 


source(“file.R”)

8. Do you have any questions about the tutorial? Nope! Pretty straight forward

Worksheet 4 - Do chapter 2 of online R tutorial http://tryr.codeschool.com/

Login to Codeschool and do chapter 2.

1.	Define the following data structures? What do you find written in them?

Boolean “logical value” like TRUE FALSE

Numeric : a number, if youre trying to retrieve a value within a vector, you would type the numerical value 

String 
A character variable that contains one or more characters 

2.	What happens if you try to combine in a vector a Boolean, a numeric and a string? 

Itll give you a NA value

3.	 What would be the result of this piece of code: seq(1, 2, 0.1)  

 Type it in to RStudio!

4.	A vector can have names. How do you call an element of a vector by its name

With names assignment 
➢	ranks <- 1:3
➢	names(ranks) <- c(“first”,  “second” , “third”)

5.	 Suppose you'd run this code to make a vector:  
sentence <- c("I", "am", "not", "learning", "R", "!", "!") and then you'd run this code: sentence[c(1,2,4,5)]
What would be the output? 

“ I”  “am”  “learning” “R”
 
Does R start counting at 0 or at 1? Is this different from Perl? 
R will start counting at 1 

6.	In chapter 2 of the online R tutorial on Codeschool, you'll learn how to make two kinds of plots. What are they? What functions do you use to make them? In each case, what goes on the x-axis and what on the y-axis? 
Bar plot and scatter plots
